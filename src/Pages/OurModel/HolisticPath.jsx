              At Vande Mataram Gurukulam, academic learning goes hand-in-hand with our value-based education. We follow the NIOS (National Institute of Open Schooling) curriculum, providing students the flexibility to learn at their own pace. Every child is enrolled under the NIOS board and guided to appear for national-level examinations.
            </p>

              Beyond the classroom, students are encouraged to pursue certifications, diploma programs, and specialized courses aligned with their swadharma (inner talent, skills and interests) â€” whether in arts, sports, sciences, or traditional knowledge systems. Additional coaching and mentorship are provided to support their unique learning paths.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600 leading-8">
              The Gurukulam takes complete responsibility for each child's academic journey until graduation, ensuring they are equipped with knowledge, values, and confidence to thrive in the modern world.
